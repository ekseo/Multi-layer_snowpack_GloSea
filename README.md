# Multi-layer_snowpack_GloSea

This repository stores python codes to perform the model evaluation of following analysis in Seo and Dirmeyer (2024, GMD). Its primary objective is to assess the seasonal cycle of snow and land surface variables throughout the snow-covered period. Furthermore, this study assesses the model's capability to replicate the mean climatology of key land surface and near-surface variables based on the model fidelity in the simulation of land-atmosphere interactions.
1. Seasonal cycle of land and near-surface variables
2. Evaluating the mean and memory of surface soil moisture
3. Model climatological bias of temperature and precipitation
4. Assessment of land coupling regime in seasonal forecast models
